                TM Marketing, a Midwest based marketing company that specializes in the deregulation of natural gas
                and electricity. It is a company founded on the principle quality over quantity. In a world that causes
                so much insecurity in who you can and canâ€™t trust, it is important to
                know that the companies we deal with have a strong code of ethics and morals. Energy deregulation,
                like anything in a free market economy is filled with different choices and options that at times can be
                misleading or confusing. We are committed to bringing beneficial quality programs to consumers in any
                deregulated market, and explaining their choices in a way that is easy to comprehend. Our client
                list ranges from small regional supply companies and marketing companies to fortune 500 corporations.
                We are always interested in new opportunities and looking for ways to improve our current ones.
