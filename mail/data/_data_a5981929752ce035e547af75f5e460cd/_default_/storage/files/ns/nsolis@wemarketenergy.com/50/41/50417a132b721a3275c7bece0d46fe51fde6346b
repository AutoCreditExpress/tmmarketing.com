ed. She pointed out a few neighbors, one of which was Rosario Cruz. She t=
old me that she was new to the neighborhood. I went about working my stre=
et as usual and ended up at Ms. Cruz's door. I immediately noticed she sp=
oke little English. Me being bilingual, I decided to give my Spanish pres=
entation. My interaction with Ms. Cruz wasn't unusual up until i asked fo=

=C2=A0I felt bad and=C2=A0wasn't sure what recommendation to make at that=
 point.=C2=A0In retrospect i know this was a bad idea but i decided to go=
 back to Ms.=C2=A0Enriquez's house and asked if she could lend her phone =
for Ms. Cruz's enrollment. She was busy on the phone but she said she had=
 a second line that Ms. Cruz could use. I borrowed that cell phone for th=
e enrollment and her daughter was sent with me to bring the phone back. I=
 know this was a huge mistake. I felt horrible i wasn't able to help out =
a possible customer and wasn't able to recommend a solution. I explained =
everything thoroughly to this customer. i know i made a mistake using ano=
